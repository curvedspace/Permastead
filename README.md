# Permastead
Desktop software for managing a homestead using permaculture design. It features observations, actions, events and inventory as well as the ability to track your plantings and seed saving over time. WARNING: this is pre-alpha software and may have breaking changes yet to come.

- Observations - these allow you to journal your observations on your property over time.
- Actions - this is essentially a TODO list that helps keep track of what needs to be done.
- Events - events are cycilical and can either be informational, or trigger TODOs in your Actions view.
- Inventory - this tracks what you have available on the homestead.
- Greehouse View - this shows your current plantings and seeds.
